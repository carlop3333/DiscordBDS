# DiscordBDS

![Downloads](https://img.shields.io/github/downloads/carlop3333/DiscordBDS/total?style=social&logo=deno)

A (experimental) addon that connects Discord and BDS (Bedrock Dedicated Server) and viceversa with your friends!

- Connect your chat from Discord to Minecraft!
- Send join/leave alerts
- Compatible with chat addons! (Requires modification)

## Coming soon:

- Adding suport for singleplayer/multiplayer worlds via wss (Realms is not in that equation, for now)
- Alerts, can be triggered with any event (configured by the player)
- And an extensible API for another addons! (including storage managing, alert triggering, etc.)
- Voice chat support (Still in the ideas box!)

**Note**: this is an experiment, it only does have the 3 features in the brief description **(mainly because it needs urgently a rewrite)**

### Also important note:
**If you want the updated source use the [Deno](https://github.com/carlop3333/DiscordBDS/tree/deno) branch, mainly because the main branch includes _garbage code_**
